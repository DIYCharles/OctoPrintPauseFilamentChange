How to Use
============

1. Open a terminal on your computer
2. Run the command
```sh
.
```


```c
void matrix_scan_user(void) {
  // if (mouse_jiggle_mode) { //Uncomment if you want to add a physical toggle switch to control it via the macro
  SEND_STRING(SS_DELAY(10000)); //10s
  tap_code(KC_MS_UP);
  tap_code(KC_MS_DOWN);
  SEND_STRING(SS_DELAY(30000)); //30s
  tap_code(KC_MS_LEFT);
  tap_code(KC_MS_RIGHT);
  // } else {
  // }
}
```


Here I declare the macro MOUSEJIGGLERMACRO and then I put it where I want it on the keymap. Since this is just a 1x1 board it is the only key. 
```c
 enum custom_keycodes {
  MOUSEJIGGLERMACRO
};

const uint16_t PROGMEM keymaps[][MATRIX_ROWS][MATRIX_COLS] = {
	KEYMAP(
		MOUSEJIGGLERMACRO)
};
```
Here I set a value mouse_jiggle_mode to false
```c
bool mouse_jiggle_mode = false;
```
Here is where the macro is registered. When the switch is down or closed the value of mouse_jiggle_mode is set to true. When it is released it is set back to false.
```c
bool process_record_user(uint16_t keycode, keyrecord_t *record) {
  switch (keycode) {
    case MOUSEJIGGLERMACRO:
      if (record->event.pressed) {
        mouse_jiggle_mode = true;
      } else {
        mouse_jiggle_mode = false;
      }
      break;
  }
  return true;
}
```

Randomizing Input work in progress
=====
Currently trying to find a way to randomize the code. My thoughts are to use a counter and only execute that code when the counter is divisable by small prime numbers. If anyone wants to help please do.
```c
int counter;
int c1;
int c2;

void matrix_scan_user(void) {
  //The purpose of the counter is to try and randomize the movements. If you do not want random movements comment this out and uncomment the part out below. 
  counter = counter + 1;
  SEND_STRING(SS_DELAY(1));
  c1 = counter % 13;
  c2 = counter % 37;
  if (c1 == 0) {
    SEND_STRING(SS_DELAY(10000));
    tap_code(KC_MS_UP);
    tap_code(KC_MS_DOWN);
  }
  if (c2 == 0) {
    SEND_STRING(SS_DELAY(30000));
    tap_code(KC_MS_LEFT);
    tap_code(KC_MS_RIGHT);
  }
  if (counter == 1000) {
    counter = 0;
  }
}
```


Compile And Flash
=====
I put a guide for this in my other repo [here](https://github.com/DIYCharles/DIYKeyboards) 

Build
============

The pro-micro I am using has a USB type C port and I got it for $5 on aliexpress. This code works on all pro micro 5V boards regardless of ports.

The 3D printing files for the case are incredibly thin and are designed for the type c pro micro.

How to add a MouseJiggler toggle macro to your QMK keyboard
============

Here is how you can add the functionality of a MouseJiggler to your QMK keyboard by using a macro to toggle it. This is all done in the keymap.c of your keyboards qmk firmware file.


First you want to declare the macro just like any other macro

```c
enum custom_keycodes {
  MOUSEJIGGLERMACRO
};
```
Next we set the jiggle mode to off by default and declare the boolean we are going to use.

```c
bool mouse_jiggle_mode = false;
```
In your keymap assign the key you want to use as the macro toggle like any other macro. I'd suggest putting this on a different layer than default. 
```c
const uint16_t PROGMEM keymaps[][MATRIX_ROWS][MATRIX_COLS] = {

	KEYMAP(
		MOUSEJIGGLERMACRO)

};
```
Where you normally define your macros we are going to have a function that will invert the boolean when you click the macro key.

```c
bool process_record_user(uint16_t keycode, keyrecord_t *record) {
  switch (keycode) {
    case MOUSEJIGGLERMACRO:
      if (record->event.pressed) {
        if (mouse_jiggle_mode)
            SEND_STRING(SS_DELAY(15));
            mouse_jiggle_mode = false;
        } else {
            SEND_STRING(SS_DELAY(15));
            mouse_jiggle_mode = true;
        }
      } else {
      }
      break;
  }
  return true;
}
```
Finally we have a function that is not normally declared in the keymap. This function scans the keyboards matrix really fast continuously. So if we stick and if statement in there that reads the boolean from our macro we can have a set of code that will perform on loop until the macro inverts the boolean again.


```c
void matrix_scan_user(void) {
  if (mouse_jiggle_mode) {
    SEND_STRING(SS_DELAY(10));
    tap_code(KC_MS_UP);
    tap_code(KC_MS_DOWN);
    SEND_STRING(SS_DELAY(30));
    tap_code(KC_MS_LEFT);
    tap_code(KC_MS_RIGHT);
  } else { 
  } 
}
```
